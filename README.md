Solutions and reference implementations for my graduate class [sequence learning](https://sikoried.github.io/sequence-learning/).


## Notes

- Contains git submodule `jstk`, so please make sure to call `git submodule init` to clone it.
- Has a gradle wrapper (4.7), but should work with any recent (4.x) gradle
